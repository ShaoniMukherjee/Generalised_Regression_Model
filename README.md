# Generalised_Regression_Model
Generalised Regression in Python

In linear regression, we had encountered problems where the target variable y was linearly related to the predictor variable X. But what if the relationship is not linear?

In generalised linear regression we analyse the scatter plots of raw attributes to create new features. 
'Linear' in Linear Regression
The second point mentioned above is so important (and so often confused) that it is worth elaborating: The model is called 'linear' because the target 
y is linearly related to the coefficients.
We fit a polynomial regression to best fit the data
